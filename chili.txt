28oz crushed tomatoes
2 diced poblano pepper
2 diced red bell peppers
2 diced orange bell peppers
2 diced yellow bell peppers
3 diced yellow onion
1 12oz Old Rasputin
30oz diced mangoes
1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips
1/2 cup honey

Spice Mix
2 T ground ginger
9 cloves of minced garlic
2 T dried oregano
1 T paprika
1 T smoked paprika
1 T pink salt
6 T ground cumin
1/2 T cinnamon
1 tsp ground black pepper
2 tsp ground ancho chili
1 tsp ground chipotle chili
1 tsp ground cayenne

Instructions:
1. Cook ground pork in a large skillet. Do not drain the grease.
2. Put cooked pork in large stock pot and add beer. Put on low heat.

4. Dice onions and peppers, and add them to the large stock pot.
5. Add spice mix and other ingredients.

Notes for Next Time:
- Too much liquid. Maybe drain the grease from the ground pork? If adding beans maybe not.
- Try only 1 T or 1.5 T ginger.
- Try only 1 cup or 1.5 cups of chocolate chips.
- Maybe more mangoes and less honey.
