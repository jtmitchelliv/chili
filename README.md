### Meats

- 2 pounds ground American Wagyu beef

### Main Ingredients

- 1 white onion, diced
- 4-ish cloves garlic, minced
- 1 16 oz Yuengling
- 1 red bell pepper, diced
- 1 orange bell pepper, diced
- 1 yellow bell pepper, diced
- 14.5 oz can diced tomatoes
- 15 oz can diced mangoes
- 1/4 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips
- 1/4 cup agave nectar
- 15.5 oz can red kidney beans

### Spice Mix

- 1 fresh ground chile ancho
- 2 fresh ground chile chipotle
- 6 fresh ground chile morita
- 3 T ground cumin
- 1 T paprika
- 1 T smoked paprika
- 2 T fresh minced ginger
- 1.5 T pink salt
- 2 tsp dried oregano
- 1 tsp cinnamon
- 2/3 tsp ground black pepper

### Instructions
1. Brown the meat in cast iron skillet. Move to stock pot.
2. Brown onions.
3. Deglaze with beer, reduce a bit. Add to pot.
4. Add tomatoes, peppers, chocolate, agave nectar, garlic, and spice mix.
5. Bring to a boil, then simmer for at least half an hour.
6. Add beans and mangoes. Simmer for a  bit and then taste.

### Notes for next time
1. Try less paprika, significantly. Maybe only use a teaspoon of smoked paprika. Add it to the ground chiles and smell it to see how it affects it.
2. Try less cumin, but more of the ground chiles.
3. Too sweet. Try less agave nectar, maybe half or not at all, or no mangoes.
4. Unpleasant earthy taste. Maybe less oregano or none at all. Maybe less chocolate. Maybe this is because of the paprika or the cumin.
